# Unsupervised construction of gene regulatory network based on single-cell multi-omics data of colorectal cancer
## scATAC-seq data preprocessing
1. [index](https://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/manual.shtml): Used in 'Bowtie2'.  
2. [Human genome annotation information](https://www.gencodegenes.org/human/): Calculate the gene symbol based on the results of calling peaks.  
## Database
1. [Gene Expression Nebulas Database](https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gen/): scRNA-seq data.  
2. [Gene Expression Omnibus Database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/): scATAC-seq data.  
##  Visualization of gene regulatory networks
1. [GRAND](https://grand.networkmedicine.org/): Visualization of gene regulatory networks. GRAND is a collection of gene regulatory networks derived from human tissues, cancer, cell lines, and small molecule drugs.     
## Accuracy verification
1. [TRRUST](https://www.grnpedia.org/trrust/): a manually curated database of human and mouse transcriptional regulatory networks.  
2. [RegNetwork](https://regnetworkweb.org/home.jsp): RegNetwork integrates the curated regulations in various databases and the potential regulations inferred based on the transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs).
